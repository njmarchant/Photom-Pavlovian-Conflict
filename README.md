MATLAB files take data from TDT saved tanks
BTN_1_ extracts the data and divides them into traces based on the timestamps saved by TDT
BTN_2_ sorts traces and combines them where necessary. It also performs z-scoring of the traces
BTN_3_ The main plotting scripts. The collect the relevant data for a given trial type, performs the statistics, and plots these as output
BTN_4_ Calculates mean of the zScore traces in defined time windows
